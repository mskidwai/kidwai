My name is Mohhid Kidwai and I'm currently a senior at the Wake Young Men's Leadership Academy in Downtown Raleigh. Next semester,
I will be studying computer science at North Carolina State University. I am very excited to attend the school and I hope to learn
a lot. My hobbies include reading and playing basketball with my friends. A fun fact about myself is that I used to play Pokemon competitively!.
